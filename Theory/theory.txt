DAY1:

datatypes:
data types are used to store some data
types:
1) primitive
numbers - 1 2 3 4....
float- 1.232323
boolean -above 18 eligible to vote (true or false)
string -'Ambika'
null- empty
undefined- 
var a=10
a
console.log(a)//undefined


2) non primitive
arrays 
objects


//coercion or typecasting converting one datatype to other
//implicit and explicit
implicit 
//implicit coercion wherein js will directly convert the datatype internally

explicit
//explicitly converting one data type to another by using datatype keywords
number, string, boolean


//DAY 2
//operators: operators are used to perform certain tasks on the variable
//Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, div 
//incrementing or decrementing  10 11 10 9
//pre inc or dec
//first incrementation or decrementation is done then priniting happens

//post inc or dec
//first value will be printed and then it will make the variable ready for the inc or dec



//even or odd 
//logical operations (and and or)
// t t t
//t f  f


//Day3

//Loops and control statements
// if else


//functions****

just a block of code to do something
print something
**** repetation of a certain task
do the operations addition


//Day 4
